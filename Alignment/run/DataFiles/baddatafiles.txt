If any data files are bad (e.g. not at CERN), put them here,
separated by newlines or spaces or nothing or whatever you like.
Anything else in this file, like these lines, will be ignored.
You can also run hippyaddtobaddatafiles.py .../align_cfg.py to automatically
find bad data files.
Running jobs will automatically pick up changes here next time they resubmit.
